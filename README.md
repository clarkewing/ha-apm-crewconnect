## About The Project
Home Assistant has allowed me to automate tons of things inside my home, but I've always found it more adapted to the "classic" 9-to-5 weekday and weekend routines most people have.

Working within an airline, I wanted to integrate my often complex and varied roster into my smart home. This integration aims to do just that, with nifty little tools to simplify management of Home Assistant around my airline roster.


### Built With
Many different open source projects made this one possible, and here they are showcased below.

- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)
- [APM CrewConnect (Python SDK)](https://github.com/clarkewing/apm_crewconnect)


### Installation
1. Install files  
    Download the [latest release](https://github.com/clarkewing/ha-apm-crewconnect/releases) as a zip file and extract it into the `custom_components` folder in your HA installation.
2. Restart Home Assistant to load the integration.
3. Go to Configuration -> Integrations and click the big orange '+' button. Look for APM CrewConnect and click to add it.
4. The UI will prompt you for your APM host.  
    _The host can be found by navigating to your APM mobile app settings and looking for the "Service URL"._
5. The configuration flow will provide you with a URL to login using OKTA (the only currently supported login option).  
    Open the provided URL in Chrome [with the console open](https://support.google.com/docs/thread/1873663/collecting-console-logs-chrome-browser-only?hl=en) and log into your account. The console should log an error saying that Chrome was unable to redirect you to a URL starting with `com.apm.crewconnect:/`.  
    Copy and paste this authentication redirect URL into the integration configuration flow.
6. The integration should now be configured properly!


## Usage
### Finding unstaffed flights
The `apm.find_unstaffed_flights` service allows you to search the flight schedule for unstaffed flights. You can filter by date, aircraft (73H or 32N), and role code (CDB, OPL, TRI, CC, CA, or INS).


## Roadmap
